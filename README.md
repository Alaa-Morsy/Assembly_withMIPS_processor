# Assembly_withMIPS_processor
this project steps:
1. Write/Get simple C code  Â ex: multiplication program of matrices 
2. Translate C code to assembly by hand Validate you translation using MARS simulator 
3. Convert assembly code to machine code using MARS assembler 
4. Upload to the memory of the single-cycle processor,
5. run the Verilog code of single-cycle processor on Modelsim and see the ISA execution
